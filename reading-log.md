I've been working from a public library a lot, sitting by shelves filled with amazing books. Here is some fascinating content which hopefully doesn't break any copyright laws. 

#### The Universal Computer (Martin Davis, 2000)

There's something in going from only a pre-defined set of state transitions in a system, to making the transitions fully programmable by the system's users. Examples that come to mind are going from a "static" editor to Emacs, introducing Javascript to the static HTML/CSS web as well as going from a contract-less blockchain to a fully programmable one. Could it be that a novel and useful system could be built just by making what appear to be static state transitions fully programmable?

The 'mother' of all such transitions is described in this book, particularly, by the two introductory quotes:

The book describes how in the early days of computers, it has not dawned on everyone that the universal computer is what needs to be built. That's the first quote. The second quote appears to be on an altogether different level: not only it suggests that a universal computer is what needs to be built, but is based on a research of _what "fully programmable" actually means_, a research conducted by Turing and others in the 30ties and leading up to the Church-Turing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church%E2%80%93Turing_thesis">thesis</a>.
