I've been working from a public library a lot, sitting by a shelf with a bunch of amazing math books. Here is a list of what I've been reading, together with some fascinating content. 

#### The Universal Computer (Martin Davis, 2000)

There's something in going from only a pre-defined set of state transitions in a system, to making the transitions fully programmable by the system's users. Examples that come to mind are going from a "static" editor to Emacs, introducing Javascript to the static HTML/CSS web as well as going from a contract-less blockchain to a fully programmable one. Could it be that a novel, useful system could be made just by making what appear to be static state transitions fully programmable?

The 'mother' of all such transitions is described in this book, particularly, by the two introductory quotes:

The book describes how in the early days of computers, it has not dawned on everyone that the universal computer is what needs to be built. That's the first quote. The second quote appears to be on an altogether different layer: not only it suggests not only that a universal computer is what needs to be built, but is based on a research of what "fully programmable/computable" actually means, a research conducted by Turing and others between the two wars and leading up to Church-Turing hypothesis.
